Inner peace refers to internal peace which come from our heart and feel by our soul, it is a psycological or spiritual state of mind when you experience a bliss, this bliss can't be purchased in the shop or by the money. For better and simple explain it is the state when the world full of messed full of stressed but you are still calm, and pretending like nothing wrong is going around you. Inner peace is something make you feel alive,

It help you live life more openly and freely. Let's take an example of a room which stufs are put in unorganized manner they are crammed one above another and the state come where there is no further place to fit the stuff. Similary, we do the same with our mind we just add the things like your worries or fear or anything else and we never clean it. 

Let's suppose if somehow we planned to clean the room by removing all unwanted things which does create a messed in the room and after cleaning you find the room is much bigger than you ever thought. 
Just like the room we need to clean our brain and our soul. This is done by inner peace if you try to empty your mind and just do nothing then at that time you will experience a bliss or a eternal joy which you cann't be express by words.
To get inner peace you have alot of ways like the first one is Just ignored everything which makes you feels bother. Second and the simplest one is spend time with nature and do yoga daily even 5 to 10 min is much. And the last do good deeds like in newton thrid law Every action has equal and opposite reaction. Similary when you generous with other than in return you will get kindness this will give you feel of satisfaction. Like once Buddha says If you conqueor your thought you will expereince a bliss our mind is like an empty pit with no dead end which if you try to fill it will never be possible. Just need a satisfaction nothing else if you are satisfied than you are experienceing inner peace		.
