My name is Priyanshu Singh it consist of first name Priyanshu which means first ray of light while the surname Singh which comes from the sanskrit word named simha it represent lions historically it is use by rajput. 
For me there is no random best memory it is like the memory which makes me feel happy at the time of stressed is my best part of memory And same case with my bad experience for today which seems bad but it future if i recall it's look good. But one of the bad experience which I have is when I loose someone close to me.
Now, talk about my hidden talent the first things which comes in my mind is my hidden talent is that's much perfectly hidden whom i am not able to discover. So, coming to the point what ever i do atleast know by 2 to 3 people so there is no hidden talent in me.
